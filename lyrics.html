There is a love that calls me by the name
Sure as the sun, the moon, the stars remain
Your love for me will never change
Jesus, Your lo - o - ove
Je - sus, Your love

There is a love that takes me by the hand
Guiding my heart to find its home again
And where You are is home to me
Jesus, Your lo - o - ove
Je - sus, Your love

So let my heart tell You again
When seasons change and stories end
Your steady love
It will sustain me through it all
Je - sus, Your love

There is a peace that stays though storms may come
I hear Your voice within the winds that blow
I hear Your song, it calls to me
Jesus, Your lo - o - ove
Je - sus, Your love

So let my heart tell You again
When seasons change and stories end
Your steady love
It will sustain me through it all
Je - sus, Your love

There is a strength that rises up in me
To know that You've been here be - fore me
A strength beyond what I can see
Jesus, Your lo - o - ove
Je - sus, Your love

So let my heart tell You again
When seasons change and stories end
Your steady love
It will sustain me through it all
Je - sus, Your love

So let my heart tell You again
When seasons change and stories end
Your steady love
It will sustain me through it all
Je - sus, Your love

There is a strength that rises up in me
To know that You've been here be - fore me
A strength beyond what I can see
Jesus, Your lo - o - ove
Je - sus, Your love

So let my heart tell You again
When seasons change and stories end
Your steady love
It will sustain me through it all
Je - sus, Your love
